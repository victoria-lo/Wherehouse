## The Project
- Built with JavaScript, HTML, Bootstrap and CSS to create a simple inventory locator system.
- Stores items with their name, quantity and which warehouse it is stored at
- Allows adding new inventory and dynamically loads table data
- Managers can search warehouses by their id and see the items stored in it
- Managers can also see remaining storage available in the warehouses

## What I Learn
- Save data to local storage
- Dynamically populating tables from local storage to DOM
- Dynamically update table when new items are added
- Filtering search results and displaying only a part of data that user wants to see
